# AmzTranscribe2SRT
A project to generate subtitle files for video from Amazon Transcribe.
This project is still being developed, so does not work yet.
When complete, it will take a JSON output from the AWS Transcribe service
and generate a corresponding SRT file, which can be added to video files.
